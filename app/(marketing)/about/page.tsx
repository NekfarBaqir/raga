        Our History and Vision
      </h2>

      <p className="mt-6 text-base md:text-lg leading-7">
        Raga was created to empower Afghanistan's brightest minds with the
        tools, space, and community they need to thrive. In a country where
        opportunities are often limited by infrastructure and resources, Raga
        provides an environment where talent and vision come first. We believe
        innovation should not be held back by circumstance — with the right
        support, Afghan youth can build solutions that matter both locally and
        globally.

      <p className="mt-6 text-base md:text-lg leading-7">
        At its core, Raga is more than just a coworking space. It is a movement
        to bring together sharp individuals and visionary teams — software
        engineers, designers, DevOps experts, and creators — who are eager to
        solve real problems for Afghan people. By offering a dedicated space
        with 24/7 electricity, fast internet, and a collaborative atmosphere, we
        make it possible for innovators to focus fully on their ideas and
        transform them into tangible projects.

        This initiative is supported by Engineer Reza Ahmadi, the founder of
        Entop and the creator of Afghanistan’s first sports car. His journey
        reflects what is possible when determination meets vision. Through Raga,
        his mission is to give the next generation of Afghans the same chance to
        dream big, build boldly, and take an active role in shaping the future
        of Afghanistan’s technology and innovation.
